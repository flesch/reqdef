# reqdef

**reqdef** is a small utility to help require a module that may be using `export default` in a CommonJS environment.

```js
$ npm install --save reqdef
```

Instead of using this:

```js
const { default: myFunction } = require('./myFunction');
// ...or...
const myFunction = require('./myFunction').default;
```

You can do this:

```js
const myFunction = require('reqdef')(require('./myFunction'));
```

**reqdef** also supports passing a module name:

```js
const myFunction = require('reqdef')('my-function-on-in-packagejson');
```
